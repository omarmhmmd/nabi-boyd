        <span>NABI BOYD</span> is a design office based in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, California.

      <br>
        We continue in the California tradition of creative, contextual design that emphasizes a connection to the landscape and natural environment. We bring with us an obsession with design, craft and building. We tend toward thoughtful, simple, warm and light, but encourage the wild, playful and curious. Weâ€™ve found that the best projects grow out of engaging with the unique qualities of each site and the people who use them.
