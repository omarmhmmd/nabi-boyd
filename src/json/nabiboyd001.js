      "DESCRIPTION": "Knø Beverage House is a new bar and cafe in Escondido, California.  Created as a reaction to the overcrowded microbrew and coffee culture of Southern California, Knø encapsulates a playful spirit of unpretentious aficionados.\nNabi Boyd designed the architecture, interiors, identity, and graphics to create a cohesive design across various media. This included producing a family of logos that worked for the various products under the Knø brand (beer, coffee, bar/café) as well as stationary, merchandise, and ephemera.\nThe Beverage House itself comprises a long, narrow masonry building on a busy street in downtown Escondido.  New doors and windows on the building ends and skylights brighten the previously dark space. A mix of high and low materials fit with the brand vibe and embrace a casual but discerning, kid-friendly but sometimes rowdy crowd. The rear patio evokes a gabled village from the outside and is made up of a modular system of slatted structures that create various shade conditions and apertures to the sky."

      "DESCRIPTION": "Located on a steep Cherimoya orchard in the foothills of Carpinteria, Shepard Mesa House is a new home for a young family of four. The neighborhood consists of dispersed homes along a single road leading up and around the crown of the hill.\n Sited diagonally to the contours of the hill, the house slopes with the natural fall of the land. Interior functions at three levels are gathered under a large gable roof. Bedrooms at the lower elevations are nestled into the working orchard around them where the trees provide the most privacy. The living room, dining area and kitchen on the upper level opens downslope and affords the most expansive views. Neighboring homes are just out of sight as the view stretches out across the valley to the backside of Rincon Mountain.\nThe siting, orientation, and plan take advantage of natural light and ventilation reducing the reliance on mechanical systems and creating a living experience in harmony with the site."

      "DESCRIPTION": "ADU for an Artist is an accessory dwelling unit designed as a flexible space that can be used for living, working, exhibiting, and storage. The space is open and adaptable with large north-facing sliding doors opening onto a garden. Three large light wells span across the main space from wall to wall. \nThe building is clad in metal shingles for fire resistance as well as a nod to the material repetition of the existing masonry home. An asymmetrical roof creates an efficient attic space above the kitchen and bathroom. Native grasses slip under and sway against the stepped foundation and floating deck, giving a lightness to the building and continuity to the landscape around it."

New guardrails, finishes, lighting, and flooring are designed throughout with a nod to the character of the building and site."

The client, a woman living on a property with her son and his young family, wanted independence while maintaining a connection to the main house. A bathing room with a view and direct sunlight would become a place where she would spend much of her time. \nThe guest house is an efficient one-bedroom unit that uses cut-in atria to separate spaces and create pockets of exterior inside. The large bathroom with a freestanding tub and direct access to a private garden creates a bright and natural experience where one could spend all day."
