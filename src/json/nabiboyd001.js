    "DESCRIPTION": "Located on a steep Cherimoya orchard in the foothills of Carpinteria, Shepard Mesa House is a new home for a young family of four. The neighborhood consists of dispersed homes along a single road leading up and around the crown of a hill.<br><br>Sited diagonally to the contours of the hill, the house slopes with the natural fall of the land. Interior functions at three different levels are gathered under a single gable roof. Bedrooms at the lower elevations are nestled into the working orchard around them where the trees provide the most privacy. The living room, kitchen and dining area on the upper level opens downslope and affords the most expansive views. Neighboring homes are just out of sight as the view stretches out across the valley to the backside of Rincon Mountain.<br><br>The siting, orientation, and plan take advantage of natural light and ventilation reducing the reliance on mechanical systems and creating a living experience in balance with the site.",

This included producing a family of logos that worked for the various products under the Knø brand (beer, coffee, bar/cafe) as well as stationary, merchandise, and ephemera.<br><br>The Beverage House itself is a long, narrow masonry building on a busy street in downtown Escondido.  New bi-fold windows and skylights brighten the previously dark space. A mix of high and low materials fit with the brand vibe and embrace a casual but discerning, kid-friendly but sometimes rowdy crowd. The rear garden patio evokes a gabled village from the outside and is made up of a modular system of slatted structures that create various shade conditions and apertures to the sky.",

The building is clad in metal shingles for fire resistance as well as a nod to the material repetition of the existing masonry home. An asymmetrical roof creates an efficient attic space above the kitchen and bathroom. Native grasses slip under and sway against the stepped foundation and floating deck, giving continuity to the landscape around it.",

This historic side of town consists of mostly small Spanish style bungalows from the 40s and industrial buildings from Ventura's oil drilling past. The three homes replace two aging structures on the lot, thoughtfully increasing density in an area with a need for additional housing and a desire to leave the surrounding open space undeveloped.<br><br>Each of the three houses is a three-bedroom, two-bath, single-family home with a private roof garden. Setback yards between the homes create areas for landscape and private entrances. Large picture windows maximize daylight and integrate full-height sliding panels that reveal hidden open air balconets. Corrugated siding is occasionally cut at a bias creating rippled edges invoking the shadows and profiles of the Spanish tile roofs around.",
