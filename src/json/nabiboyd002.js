      "DESCRIPTION": "Located on a steep Cherimoya orchard in the foothills of Carpinteria, Shepard Mesa House is a new home for a young family of four. The neighborhood consists of dispersed homes along a single road leading up and around the crown of the hill.<br><br>Sited diagonally to the contours of the hill, the house slopes with the natural fall of the land. Interior functions at three levels are gathered under a large gable roof. Bedrooms at the lower elevations are nestled into the working orchard around them where the trees provide the most privacy. The living room, dining area and kitchen on the upper level opens downslope and affords the most expansive views. Neighboring homes are just out of sight as the view stretches out across the valley to the backside of Rincon Mountain.<br><br>The siting, orientation, and plan take advantage of natural light and ventilation reducing the reliance on mechanical systems and creating a living experience in harmony with the site.",

Created as a reaction to the overcrowded microbrew and coffee culture of Southern California, Knø encapsulates a playful spirit of unpretentious aficionados.<br><br>Nabi Boyd designed the architecture, interiors, identity, and graphics to create a cohesive design across various media. This included producing a family of logos that worked for the various products under the Knø brand (beer, coffee, bar/cafø) as well as stationary, merchandise, and ephemera.<br><br>The Beverage House itself comprises a long, narrow masonry building on a busy street in downtown Escondido.  New doors and windows on the building ends and skylights brighten the previously dark space. A mix of high and low materials fit with the brand vibe and embrace a casual but discerning, kid-friendly but sometimes rowdy crowd. The rear patio evokes a gabled village from the outside and is made up of a modular system of slatted structures that create various shade conditions and apertures to the sky.",
